## 🔐 Security

This project was designed and reviewed using an OWASP-inspired checklist for mobile applications.  
Key points:

- **Input Validation:** User input (city search) is sanitized and validated before being sent to the API.
- **Network Security:** All API calls use HTTPS with secure network configuration.
- **Secrets Management:** The OpenWeather API key is injected via `local.properties` / `BuildConfig` and never hardcoded.
- **Error Handling:** User-facing errors avoid exposing internal stack traces or sensitive details.
- **Hardening:** Release builds use code obfuscation (R8/ProGuard) and minimized logging.
